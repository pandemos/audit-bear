Welcome to AuditBear!  This website is intended for election officials and observers in counties using ES&amp;S iVotronic voting machines.  If this is your first time here, please visit <a href="/about">our About page</a>.  
</p>
<p>
To analyze your election, please upload a .zip file in the box below.  The .zip file must include an EL 152 (event log) file and an EL 155 (vote images) file.  You may also optionally include an EL 68A (system log) file.  These files can be exported by election officials from the ES&amp;S Unity ERM software, after the election is over.  
</p>

<p>After submitting your zipped file, please be patient.<br/>
<b>Processing may take several minutes.</b><br/>
