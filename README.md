# Audit Bear
Audit Bear is a web application to analyze audit log data from the iVotronic
electronic voting machines and detect various anomalies and problems.

Exported from code.google.com/p/audit-bear

## Setup

This requires web2py from http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download
It does not have a requirements.txt file, so good luck. Not using a virtualenv, I needed to install:
- matplotlib
