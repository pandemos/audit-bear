\smsubsection{Incomplete Audit Data}
When a machine
appears in the event log with recorded votes cast on it during
election day, but does not appear in the ballot image file, this
indicates that some ballots are missing from the ballot image
database. Incomplete DRE ballot images will prevent accurate manual
recount procedures. The reverse situation reveals the opposite
procedural error: the event log is not complete.  We developed a
technique that identifies incomplete databases.   

This analysis requires an event log and a ballot image file, where
both files record machine serial numbers for any events and ballots
cast.  Our analysis crosschecks these files for inconsistencies by comparing the
number of ballots in the ballot image file with the number of cast vote events
in the event log. If the numbers do not match we report file 
inconsistencies and provide the user with the machine serial number
and the conflicting vote counts.
