\smsection{Conclusion}
We recommend that election administrators conduct routine reviews of the audit
logs generated by the voting machines as they contain useful information that
can shed light on procedural and election equipment issues. This paper develops
methods to analyze audit data from DRE voting machines. We perform a variety of
analyses 
on the DRE audit data to detect possible miscounts, procedural errors, voting
machine malfunctions, or system deficiencies. With this information, election
officials can improve poll worker training, election official checklists,
election tabulation procedures, and voting machine preparation testing.

We built a web application to perform these analyses. Users can upload the DRE
log files to our website and run the analyses. By 
automating our analyses we can provide intelligent feedback to election
officials during the canvassing process and help them quickly correct any
problems in order to produce accurate election results. These analyses are
freely available online at www.audit-bear.org.
